The transient keyword is used to indicate that a particular instance variable should not be serialized. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which is commonly used when saving the state of an object to a file or sending it over a network. If a field is declared as transient, it will not be included in the serialized representation of the object.

Real-Life Scenario: Sensitive Data (e.g., Password)
Consider a real-world scenario where you're working on an application that stores user information. The application may need to serialize user data to save it to a file or send it over a network. However, sensitive fields like a password should not be serialized for security reasons.

The transient keyword is used to mark the password field as non-serializable, ensuring that it is not part of the serialized object.
